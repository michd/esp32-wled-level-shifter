# ESP32 WLED Level Shifter

A simple board to house an ESP32 dev board and a level shifter, so it can be hooked up directly to a powered 5V LED strip.

This fits a "ESP-32S Development Board", which can be found by plenty of sellers.

Designed for APA102 LEDs, so it has a CLK and DATA output.

Comes with a KiCad (6) board design and 3D-printable enclosure designed in FreeCAD.

See [Releases](https://github.com/michd/esp32-wled-level-shifter/releases) for exported PCB manufacturing files and STL files to 3D print.

On both long sides, there are tabs with holes in them to fix the box to something with screws.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michd/esp32-wled-level-shifter/main/images/box-bottom.png?raw=true)

Assembled, in real life.

In the clearing for the connector, you guessed it, there's the connector, flush with the edge of the enclosure.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michd/esp32-wled-level-shifter/main/images/assembled-photo.jpg?raw=true)
